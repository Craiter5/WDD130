    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose I want to expound upon for Kardynil, is to make video games that can bring smiles to faces 
      and create memories to look back on.</p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
    
    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td class="primary"></td>
        <td class="secondary"></td>
        <td class="accent1"></td>
        <td class="accent2"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Cinzel
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Helvetica
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      An example of one of the games I have planned, Fae is a prank and break centered game. 
      In Fae, players take on the role of mischievous fairies who are trying to prevent other players 
      from earning points. The game is designed to be played with 6-10 players per lobby and is 
      intended to be a fun and light-hearted experience for all involved.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      On the more adventurous side, I have a game idea base around exploration, swords and sorcery, 
      and many other things like making flying ships. Meirian Adventures is a game that I plan 
      on making based off my homemade D&D world. This game would be completly open world, complete 
      with underground cities and caverns, flying islands, and many other things to explore.
